Since that moment over 4000 years ago ( 2000 BC ), cucumber was spread beyond Indian borders, moved through Ancient Greece, Rome, Europe, America and China. This journey was filed with golden periods when they were viewed as integral parts of many cultureâ€™s cuisines, and sometimes they were treated as bringers of disease. Roman Empire was the place where cucumbers were truly embraced by both nobility and lower classes. The ease of production and wide variety of types and tastes ensured that cucumbers remained popular in Italy for several centuries.
